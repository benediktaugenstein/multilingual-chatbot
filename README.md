Currently, it is able to understand and respond to very simple sentences. These include:

- Greetings (e.g. hello, hey, ...)
- Asking the chatbot how it feels (e.g. How are you?)
- Asking where the chatbot comes from / what it is (e.g. What are you?)
- Asking the chatbot for it's name (e.g. What is your name?)
