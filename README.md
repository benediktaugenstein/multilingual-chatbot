Currently, it is able to understand and respond to very simple sentences in over 100 languages.

The chatbot is able to understand sentences in the following areas:

- Greetings (e.g. hello, hey, ...)
- Asking the chatbot how it feels (e.g. How are you?)
- Asking the chatbot for it's name (e.g. What is your name?)
- Asking the chatbot for the time or the date (e.g. What time is it? What is the current date?)
- Asking where the chatbot comes from / what it is (e.g. What are you?)

The chatbot has been developed using TensorFlow as well as Flask to create the Web App.
